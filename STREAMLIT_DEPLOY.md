## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check the logs** in Streamlit Cloud (they're very detailed)

2. **Common fixes**:
   - Make sure all files are pushed: `git status`
   - Verify requirements.txt has all packages
   - Test locally: `streamlit run app.py`

3. **Model file size issues?**
   - Streamlit Cloud free tier supports up to 1GB
   - Your models are small, so this shouldn't be an issue

### If app is slow:
- This is normal on the free tier
- Can upgrade to $20/month for dedicated resources
